To start mysqld at boot time you have to copy
support-files/mysql.server to the right place for your system

PLEASE REMEMBER TO SET A PASSWORD FOR THE MySQL root USER !
To do so, start the server, then issue the following commands:

  ./bin/mysqladmin -u root password 'new-password'
  ./bin/mysqladmin -u root -h localhost.localdomain password 'new-password'

Alternatively you can run:

  ./bin/mysql_secure_installation

which will also give you the option of removing the test
databases and anonymous user created by default.  This is
strongly recommended for production servers.

See the manual for more instructions.

You can start the MySQL daemon with:

  cd . ; ./bin/mysqld_safe &

You can test the MySQL daemon with mysql-test-run.pl

  cd mysql-test ; perl mysql-test-run.pl

Please report any problems with the ./bin/mysqlbug script!

The latest information about MySQL is available on the web at

  http://www.mysql.com

Support MySQL by buying support/licenses at http://shop.mysql.com

New default config file was created as ./my.cnf and
will be used by default by the server when you start it.
You may edit this file to change server settings

WARNING: Default config file /etc/my.cnf exists on the system
This file will be read by default by the MySQL server
If you do not want to use this, either remove it, or use the
--defaults-file argument to mysqld_safe when starting the server
```
```bash
cp ./support-files/mysql.server  /etc/rc.d/init.d/mysqld
chmod 755 /etc/init.d/mysqld
chkconfig mysqld on
vi /etc/rc.d/init.d/mysqld
service mysqld start
```
```text
Starting MySQL. ERROR! The server quit without updating PID file (/data/mysql/localhost.localdomain.pid).
```
安装好之后，设置MySQL环境变量
```bash
echo 'export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/mysql/bin' >> /etc/profile
```
保存后，执行下面的命令，使环境变量生效
```bash
source /etc/profile
```
检查MySQL是否安装成功
```bash
mysql --version
```

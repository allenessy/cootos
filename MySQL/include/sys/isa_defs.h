/*
 * This header file serves to group a set of well known defines and to
 * set these for each instruction set architecture.
 * Portions of this header file that were not relevant for Linux are cut out.
 *
 * Processor Characteristics:
 *
 * _LITTLE_ENDIAN / _BIG_ENDIAN:
 *	The natural byte order of the processor.  A pointer to an int points
 *	to the least/most significant byte of that int.
 *
 * _STACK_GROWS_UPWARD / _STACK_GROWS_DOWNWARD:
 *	The processor specific direction of stack growth.  A push onto the
 *	stack increases/decreases the stack pointer, so it stores data at
 *	successively higher/lower addresses.  (Stackless machines ignored
 *	without regrets).
 *
 * _LONG_LONG_HTOL / _LONG_LONG_LTOH:
 *	A pointer to a long long points to the most/least significant long
 *	within that long long.
 *
 * _BIT_FIELDS_HTOL / _BIT_FIELDS_LTOH:
 *	The C compiler assigns bit fields from the high/low to the low/high end
 *	of an int (most to least significant vs. least to most significant).
 *
 * _IEEE_754:
 *	The processor (or supported implementations of the processor)
 *	supports the ieee-754 floating point standard.  No other floating
 *	point standards are supported (or significant).  Any other supported
 *	floating point formats are expected to be cased on the ISA processor
 *	symbol.
 *
 * _CHAR_IS_UNSIGNED / _CHAR_IS_SIGNED:
 *	The C Compiler implements objects of type `char' as `unsigned' or
 *	`signed' respectively.  This is really an implementation choice of
 *	the compiler writer, but it is specified in the ABI and tends to
 *	be uniform across compilers for an instruction set architecture.
 *	Hence, it has the properties of a processor characteristic.
 *
 * _CHAR_ALIGNMENT / _SHORT_ALIGNMENT / _INT_ALIGNMENT / _LONG_ALIGNMENT /
 * _LONG_LONG_ALIGNMENT / _DOUBLE_ALIGNMENT / _LONG_DOUBLE_ALIGNMENT /
 * _POINTER_ALIGNMENT / _FLOAT_ALIGNMENT:
 *	The ABI defines alignment requirements of each of the primitive
 *	object types.  Some, if not all, may be hardware requirements as
 * 	well.  The values are expressed in "byte-alignment" units.
 *
 * _MAX_ALIGNMENT:
 *	The most stringent alignment requirement as specified by the ABI.
 *	Equal to the maximum of all the above _XXX_ALIGNMENT values.
 *
 * _ALIGNMENT_REQUIRED:
 *	True or false (1 or 0) whether or not the hardware requires the ABI
 *	alignment.
 *
 * _LONG_LONG_ALIGNMENT_32
 *	The 32-bit ABI supported by a 64-bit kernel may have different
 *	alignment requirements for primitive object types.  The value of this
 *	identifier is expressed in "byte-alignment" units.
 *
 * _HAVE_CPUID_INSN
 *	This indicates that the architecture supports the 'cpuid'
 *	instruction as defined by Intel.  (Intel allows other vendors
 *	to extend the instruction for their own purposes.)
 *
 *
 * Implementation Choices:
 *
 * _ILP32 / _LP64:
 *	This specifies the compiler data type implementation as specified in
 *	the relevant ABI.  The choice between these is strongly influenced
 *	by the underlying hardware, but is not absolutely tied to it.
 *	Currently only two data type models are supported:
 *
 *	_ILP32:
 *		Int/Long/Pointer are 32 bits.  This is the historical UNIX
 *		and Solaris implementation.  Due to its historical standing,
 *		this is the default case.
 *
 *	_LP64:
 *		Long/Pointer are 64 bits, Int is 32 bits.  This is the chosen
 *		implementation for 64-bit ABIs such as SPARC V9.
 *
 *	_I32LPx:
 *		A compilation environment where 'int' is 32-bit, and
 *		longs and pointers are simply the same size.
 *
 *	In all cases, Char is 8 bits and Short is 16 bits.
 *
 * __x86
 *	This is ONLY a synonym for defined(__i386) || defined(__amd64)
 *	which is useful only insofar as these two architectures share
 *	common attributes.  Analogous to __sparc.
